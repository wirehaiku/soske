# Soske

**Soske** (*Stephen's Old-School Key Engine*, pronounced *sosÂ·kay*) is a command-line key-value store written in [Go 1.20][gver] by [Stephen Malone][stvm].
It's designed to be a simple, portable plaintext data-dumpster.

```bash
# TODO: A slick Asciinema demo.
```

## Installation

Install Soske with `go install`...

```
go install github.com/wirehaiku/Soske@latest
```

...or download the [latest release][rels] for your platform.

## Configuration

Soske stores all its data in a single [Bolt][bolt] database in either [`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`][xdgs] or [`%APPDATA%`][appd], depending on your platform.
The database itself is an open standard and there are commands to easily import and export your data.

## Commands

Soske's syntax uses the form `soske <command> <args...>` and is always variadic, meaning you can include multiple final arguments to apply the command multiple times.
On success, commands print the requested data or nothing; on failure they print an error message in the form of `Error: <error>.`.

### `lst SUBSTRINGS...`

List all existing keys containing a substring, or all keys if no arguments are provided.
Arguments starting with `!` negate the filter, multiple arguments apply multiple filters.

```
$ soske lst
alpha
bravo
charlie

$ soske !alpha !bravo
charlie
```

### `get KEYS...`

Print the value of each key if it exists, or do nothing:

```
$ soske get alpha
Aye aye aye! 
```

### `set KEY VALUES...`

Set the value of a new or existing key. 
Multiple arguments are combined into a single newline-separated value.

```
$ soske set alpha one two three
$ soske get alpha
one
two
three
```

### `del KEYS...`

Delete each key if it exists, or do nothing:

```
$ soske del alpha
```

### `exp FILES...`

Export the entire database as compact JSON to each file.

```
$ soske exp test.json
$ cat test.json
{"alpha": "Aye aye aye!"}
```

### `imp FILES...`

Import each JSON file into the database.

```
$ echo '{"alpha": "Aye aye aye!"}' > test.json
$ soske imp test.json
$ soske get alpha
Aye aye aye!
```
